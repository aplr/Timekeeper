# ``Timekeeper``

Timekeeper is an easy-to-use timing library written in Swift, with support for iOS, tvOS, watchOS and macOS.

## Overview

Timekeeper makes it relly easy to measure timings, as shown in the code snippet below.

```swift
import Timekeeper

// Start a new timing
Timekeeper.shared.start("measurement")

for _ in 0..<100 {
    operationToMeasure()

    // Print the elapsed time since start or the last lap
    Timekeeper.shared.lap(print: "measurement")
}

// Print the elapsed time since the last lap
// as well as the total time
Timekeeper.shared.stop(print: "measurement")
```

## Installation

Timekeeper is available via the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) which is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system and automates the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Timekeeper as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/aplr/Timekeeper.git",
        .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.1")
    )
]
```
