Timekeeper is an easy-to-use time measurement library written in Swift, with support for iOS, tvOS, watchOS and macOS.

## Installation

Timekeeper is available via the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) which is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system and automates the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Timekeeper as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/aplr/Timekeeper.git",
        .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.1")
    )
]
```

## Usage

```swift
import Timekeeper

// Start a new measurement
Timekeeper.shared.start("measurement")

// Print the elapsed time since start
Timekeeper.shared.lap(print: "measurement")

// Print the elapsed time since the last lap
Timekeeper.shared.lap(print: "measurement")

// Print the elapsed time since the last lap and start and clears the measurement
Timekeeper.shared.stop(print: "measurement")
```

```swift
// Start a new measurement
Timekeeper.shared.start("measurement")

// Add a new lap and return the measurement
let measurement = Timekeeper.shared.lap("measurements")

// Stop the timer and return the measurement
let measurement = Timekeeper.shared.stop("measurement")
```

## Documentation

Documentation is available [here](https://timekeeper.aplr.io) and provides a comprehensive documentation of the library's public interface. Expect usage examples and guides to be added shortly. For now, have a look at the demo app in the *Example* directory.
